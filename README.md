# LED Cube Project

### Course: Microprocessor and Interface  
### Objective: 
The project aims to design and implement a 3D LED cube controlled by a microprocessor to demonstrate interfacing concepts and real-time light animations.



## Overview
This repository contains the implementation details of an LED Cube project, created for the course **Microprocessor and Interface**. The project involves interfacing a microprocessor (e.g., Arduino, STM32, PIC, etc.) with a 3D array of LEDs to produce dynamic light animations.

The project highlights:
- **LED Matrix Design**: A cube-shaped LED arrangement (e.g., 4x4x4 or 8x8x8).
- **Microprocessor Programming**: Controlling the cube with a microcontroller.
- **Light Animations**: Patterns, effects, and sequences.
- **Interfacing Concepts**: GPIO, shift registers, multiplexing.

## Features
- Dynamic light animations controlled by software.
- Hardware design demonstrating multiplexing and GPIO control.
- Easy-to-follow code for animation customization.
- Modular design for hardware and software.

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: [Specify the microcontroller, e.g., Arduino Uno, STM32, etc.]
- **LEDs**: [Number of LEDs, e.g., 64 LEDs for a 4x4x4 cube]
- **Resistors**: [Value and purpose]
- **Power Supply**: [Voltage and amperage requirements]
- **Shift Registers/Drivers**: (e.g., 74HC595, ULN2003)
- **Connecting Wires**
